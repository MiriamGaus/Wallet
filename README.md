Create a program to store your incomes and expenses in a database. You should be able to add incomes and expenses to the database. For each entry the program should store the following data: date (year, month and day), type (income or expense), category (like household, food, party, travel, scholarship, salary, money from poker games, etc.), the amount (given in HUF, EUR or whatever you want). The program should be able to:

- load existing database into memory (create a new if there is no database yet),
- add new income/expense entry into the database,
- save the database (from the memory) into a file,
- create new categories on user’s request,
- display your total expenses and incomes, the name of the most expensive category and the money you spent for that category, and your overall balance (the money you have) – this means evaluating all entries of the database,
- for a user selected time period (the user may enter the start and end date of the period) display statistics for each category (total spent, total income, largest expense).
